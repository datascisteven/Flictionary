# Introduction:

A ragtag group of 8 alumni comprising of 2 DS, 5 SE, and 1 UX/UI banded together for the Flatiron School Game Jam.  The hackathon was centered around the theme of Pursuing Mastery and was conducted by SE alum Cody Miller. This was an opportunity for Flatiron alums from the different programs (software engineers, data scientists, designers, and cybersecurity) to synergistically (and sometimes not) build something together through the medium of a game. The game can be anything that the group brainstorms together on the first day, but it is all about making an enjoyable experience.

This repository represents the continued efforts of this hodgepodge of Flatiron alumni to build a Pictionary-inspired gaming app, which we ultimately named Flictionary, but as the lead of the back-end team, this repo represents more of the backend efforts to develop a neural network for deployment onto Flask.

# Background:

Here were some of the guidelines we were given:

- Use all of your diverse skills to collaborate and put something together that showcases the value of Pursuing Mastery through the medium of developing a game.
- Making a game can be a lot of fun, having to think through the logic of everything that happens in your game and anticipate how the user will play your game is a blast.
- Make sure you are utilizing the skills of your entire team when building this thing is a challenge.
- Working together with others that think differently than you is an invaluable experience that will pay dividends in the job search and your career in general.

# Blog:

Please stay tuned for the blog on Medium describing our brainstorming process, group dynamics, recap of our group chats and meetings, what our successes and challenges were, what I learned from the experience, as well as our future steps.

While there were many passionate people working hard over the past two weeks on this project,


# Data Sources:

The Quick Draw Dataset is a collection of 50 million drawings across 345 categories, contributed by players of the game Quick, Draw!. The drawings were captured as timestamped vectors, tagged with metadata including what the player was asked to draw and in which country the player was located. You can browse the recognized drawings on [quickdraw.withgoogle.com/data](https://quickdraw.withgoogle.com/data).

Kaggle hosted a Quick, Draw! Doodle Recognition Challenge 3 years ago, and we used the dataset for some of the models:  [https://www.kaggle.com/c/quickdraw-doodle-recognition/data](https://www.kaggle.com/c/quickdraw-doodle-recognition/data)

# Data Understanding:

We focused on developing a game for  There were 47 animals in the dataset out of the 345 categories.

# Modeling:

For the backend, there were two considerations for developing the model:

1. Which set of image files to
