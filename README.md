# Introduction

The repository represents the continued effort of a hodgepodge of Flatiron alumnni to build a Pictionary-inspired gaming app, Flictionary, including the Software Engineering, Data Science, and UX/UI programs.

This was the one in a series of Flatiron School Hackathons spearheaded by Cody Miller, and I am grateful to be a participant of.
